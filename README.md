# Road Trip

Expo (SDK 58) app that records your drive in the background and stores every trip on the device (SQLite).

## Layout

```
src/
  app/                    Expo Router routes (thin wrappers around screens)
    _layout.js            root stack; imports locationService first so the background task is
                          defined at launch, and resumes an interrupted drive
    (tabs)/_layout.js     bottom tabs + "● Recording" strip above the tab bar
    (tabs)/index.js       → HomeScreen (latest trip with map preview, totals)
    (tabs)/record.js      → RecordScreen (START/STOP, live metrics, Google Maps button)
    (tabs)/trips.js       → PastTripsScreen
    (tabs)/settings.js    → SettingsScreen
    trips/[id].js         → TripScreen (a single-drive trip shows the drive inline)
    drives/[id].js        → DriveScreen

## Trips, drives and days

- A **drive** is one START → STOP recording. A **trip** contains one or more drives.
- On START, if the last drive ended within 3 days, the app offers **Continue "<trip>"** or **Start a new trip**.
- **Days** aren't stored: drives are grouped by the local date they started. Only driving days are numbered (Day 1, 2, 3).
- Trip totals add up distance, driving time, climbing and stops, and take the maximum top speed, altitude and longest stint. Overall average speed uses time on the road only, so overnight breaks are excluded.
- Trip options: edit name and notes, delete, or (for a single drive) add it to another trip. Drive options: move to another trip or a new one, delete.

## How the metrics work

All data is stored in metric (metres, m/s). The Settings page switches the display between km and miles.

- **Distance**: Haversine sum of consecutive fixes. Fixes with horizontal accuracy worse than 50 m, or jumps faster than 324 km/h, are dropped.
- **Rest stops / auto-pause**: staying within 100 m of one spot for 5+ minutes. A crawling traffic jam keeps leaving that radius, so it counts as driving, not a stop. On iOS no fixes arrive while you're parked, so a long gap between fixes is judged by its average speed.
- **Moving time** is the elapsed time minus rest stops, minus idle time before you first move or after your last movement.
- **Average speed**: *while moving* = distance / moving time; *overall* = distance / total elapsed time, stops included.
- **Top speed** is the highest speed held for at least 3 seconds, so a single GPS spike doesn't count.
- **Elevation gain** uses a 5 m hysteresis. Note that Android GPS altitude is usually height above the WGS84 ellipsoid, not sea level, so max altitude can be off by tens of metres.
- **Longest stint** is the most driving time between rest stops. The Record tab's *Since Break* tile shows the current one.
- **Place names** for the start, end and rest stops come from the phone's reverse geocoder after a trip ends. Lookups that fail while offline are retried when you open the trip.

## Running on your phone

### Option A: Expo Go (quick UI check, foreground only)

```bash
npm install
npx expo start --go --tunnel
```

`--go` is needed because `expo-dev-client` is installed; without it the QR code targets the development build. In Expo Go, tap **Enter URL manually** and type the `Metro: exp://…` address from the terminal with `exp` changed to `exps`. Plain `exp://` (http) was blocked on our home network, but `exps://` (https) works. Expo Go **can't** run background location. The app detects this and records only while it's open, and shows a warning on the dashboard.

### Option B: Development build (needed for real background tracking)

Using EAS in the cloud (no Xcode or Android Studio needed):

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest login
npx eas-cli@latest build:configure
npx eas-cli@latest build --profile development --platform android   # or ios
```

Install the build on your phone from the link EAS gives you, then run `npx expo start` and open the project from the dev build.

Or build locally with the phone plugged in:

```bash
npx expo run:android --device
npx expo run:ios --device       # needs Xcode + a signing team
```

For iOS dev builds on your own device, turn on **Developer Mode** (Settings → Privacy & Security). An Apple Developer account is required for EAS iOS builds.

### Permissions on the phone

Tapping **START TRIP** the first time shows a short explanation, then the system location prompt.

- Choose **Precise** and **While using the app** (iOS: **Allow While Using App**). "Allow all the time" is **not** needed: tracking starts while the app is open and continues in the background through the Android foreground-service notification or the iOS blue location indicator.
- If location is turned off or set to approximate, the app explains this and offers a shortcut to Settings.
- On aggressive battery savers (some Samsung and Xiaomi phones), set Road Trip's battery use to **Unrestricted** if routes have gaps.

### Google Maps key (Android builds only)

On Android, `react-native-maps` uses Google Maps. Expo Go includes its own key. For dev and production builds, create a Maps SDK for Android key and put it in `.env`:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key
```

`app.config.js` reads this key at build time. iOS uses Apple Maps, so it needs no key.
